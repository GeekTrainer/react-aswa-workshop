# Azure Static Web Apps

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) is a preview service which allows you to automatically build and deploy full stack web applications from a GitHub repository to Azure. With Azure Static Web Apps you're able to develop using the front end framework you like (such as Angular, React or Vue.js), and have an integrated deployment pipeline using GitHub.

To help you get started, I've created a workshop based around this repository. It will walk you through the basic features.

## Scenario

We want to display a list of dog names on a page. We will start by running everything in the client and deploy our page to Azure. We'll then add server-side code through Azure functions and test it locally. We'll close by deploying our changes to Azure. All of this will be completed with just a few tools installed locally, GitHub, and of course Azure.

## Tooling

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run Azure Functions Core Tools
- [Azure Function Core Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-functions-core-tools)
